# PW-milcom-tracker
Built to track military data in browser game Politics And War
All code has been written, and should be executed in R

Hostile allaince tracker is meant to track the military information of all the nations in a hostile alliance.
User needs to enter their api key and the alliance id of the hostile to retrieve the data in the form of a google sheet.
