# PW-milcom-tracker
Built to track military data in browser game Politics And War.
All code has been written, and should be executed in R

Hostile allaince sheet generator is meant to track the military information of all the nations in a hostile alliance.
User needs to enter their api key and the alliance id of the hostile to retrieve the data in the form of a google sheet.

Alliance militarization tracker is meant to track the defcon (in %) of user's own alliance.
User needs to enter their api key, alliance id, and the defcon requirement to retrieve the data in the form of a google sheet.
User should run code frequently to update the data, as the sheet isn't autoupdating.

I am looking to decrease API calls in future updates
